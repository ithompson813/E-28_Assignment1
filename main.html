    <p id=about_me>
        All this originated because I was bored during quarantine and decided to take cs50. 
        I continued taking the follow-up class focused on web development cs33 and had a great time, so here I am to learn more! 
        My career background is in Digital Marketing, and I'm hoping to transition into a more tech focused role after this.

    <p id=fav_restaurant> 
        My favorite restaurant is called <a href="https://foundryonelm.com/" target="_blank">Foundry On Elm</a> 
        and is located in Davis Square, Somerville (try the poutine, you wont regret it)
    </p>

    <p id=fav_place>
        I'd say my favorite place is my home, and I live right near this place: Teele Square
